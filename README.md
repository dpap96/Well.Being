# Well.Being

Apart from computer science, I am also interested in psychology. This website is a simple approach to a site that contains articles on psychology, well-being, basic concentration techniques, wellness, etc. Besides knowledge, equally important is the aspect of good mood, psychology, and discipline to achieve our goals. This particular site is the second site I have created. It consists of HTML and CSS in the CSS environment without the use of any framework (I am still a beginner :p). A first approach to achieving a big goal! To become better at programming!!!!

About this site:

It consists of three pages: index.html, which contains basic articles and a quote, login.html, where the user can log in as a member to the site, and there is also a way to communicate through an embedded QR code that someone can scan and be directed to another site (also in its initial form), and a forgotPassword.html page where the user can enter their mobile phone number to receive a code in order to be able to reconnect.
